# Hyprland install for ArchLinux

It contains a collection of dot config files for hyprland with a simple install script.
IMPORTANT - This script is meant to run on a clean fresh Arch install on physical hardware

You can grab the config files and install packages by hand with the command listed below

Now install Hyprland using the attached script "set-hypr".

# Note

As per my preference I usually keep all my cloned repos in ~/Documents, therefore this script will assume the same and maybe copy some files there if cloned elsewhere 

# Thanks for the base
